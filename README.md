# Optimised bubble sort 
This variation of bubble sort continuously compares the numbers in a given array and swaps them if the preceding element is larger. This keeps on repeating until the whole array of numbers are in ascending order

# Binary Insertion Sort
In this variation of Insertion Sort, instead of searching through the array one element at a time, it utilizes Binary Search to find the exact position where an element can fit into the already sorted part of the array. Therefore, instead of shifting elements one by one, the insertion point is found in faster time, thus reducing the number of comparisons. However, the number of shifts still remains unchanged.

# Cocktail Shaker sort
In this variation of Bubble Sort, the array is being sorted in both directions alternatively. First, it goes from left to right across the array, swapping adjacent elements wherever required. Then, it comes back from right to left, pushing larger elements to the end of the array and smaller elements to the beginning. This cycle continues until no more swaps need to be made.
